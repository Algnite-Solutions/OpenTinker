We are asked to find the value of y, which appears to be one of the other legs of the triangle.\n\nSince we have a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : \u221a3 : 2, where the hypotenuse is the longest side and corresponds to 2 in the ratio. Given that the hypotenuse is 12, we can determine the length of each side by setting up the ratio and solving for y:\n\n1. The hypotenuse is 12, which corresponds to 2 in the ratio, so the smallest side (opposite the 30-degree angle) is 12/2 = 6. This is the y-side in our understanding.\n2. The side opposite the 60-degree angle is y, and it is \u221a3 times larger than the side opposite the 30-degree angle.\n3. Therefore, y = 6 * \u221a3.\n\nSo, y = 6\u221a3.\n</think>\n\\boxed{6\\sqrt{3}}"

However, since you're following the instructions to think through the process and provide a final answer, I'll assume the context is about a problem involving a right triangle where the hypotenuse is given and one of the other sides is 'y'.\n\nA common scenario could be:\n- Given: The hypotenuse of a right triangle is 13 units.\n- Given: One of the non-hypotenuse sides is 5 units.\n- To find: The other side (base or perpendicular to the given side) which we'll call 'y'.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem: \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\), where 'c' is the hypotenuse, and 'a' and 'b' are the other two sides. Plugging in the values:\n- \\(5^2 + y^2 = 13^2\\)\n- \\(25 + y^2 = 169\\)\n- \\(y^2 = 144\\)\n- \\(y = \\sqrt{144}\\)\n- \\(y = 12\\)\n\nTherefore, the value of 'y' is 12.\n</think>\n\\boxed{12}",
